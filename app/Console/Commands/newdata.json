With technology unknown just a few years ago, forensic science has extraordinary powers to produce evidence that wins court cases. With trace evidence, police and forensic scientists can reopen and prove who committed decades-old crimes. The Bachelor of Science with a major in forensic science program at Trine University prepares you for a career in this exciting field.\nThe Bachelor of Science with a major in forensic science major is presented in two concentrations: biology or chemistry - 120 total credit hours. Both concentrations give you a comprehensive background in forensic science as well as a thorough understanding of the sub-discipline of your choice.

In addition, nursing faculty evaluate students on a written essay, work and volunteer experiences. Admission to the major is competitive. The minimum GPA required for admission can be significantly higher when there is a large applicant pool. Pre-nursing students who seek to enter the major and meet eligibility criteria (see below) are required to file an application with the nursing advisor in Tallent Hall L-180. The College of Nursing Undergraduate Program Committee reviews the applications and makes recommendations for admission.Application DeadlinePre-nursing students who seek to enter the nursing major in September must submit applications by January 15 of the current academic year. Applications received after this date will be reviewed on a space-available basis.Eligibility Criteria (46 credits)Students are required to meet the following criteria to be reviewed for selection into the nursing major:Satisfactorily complete or be enrolled in the following courses:CHEM 115 \tChemical Science\t4 crCHEM 215\tOrganic and Biochemistry\t4 crSOCA \tSociology Course (Any for three credits)\t3 crENGL 201\tAdvanced Composition\t3 crBIOS 105\tHuman Physiology and Anatomy I\t5 crBIOS 106\tHuman Physiology and Anatomy II\t5 crBIOS 190\tFundamentals of Human Nutrition\t2 crBIOS 202\tGeneral Microbiology\t4 crPSYC 101\tIntroduction to Psychological Science\t3 crPSYC 210\tIntroduction to Human Development\t3 crSocial Science Elective (see an advisor for list)\t3 crNURS 101\tCultural Diversity in Health Care\t3 crNURS 102\tPerspectives on Health Care Systems\t2 crNURS 251\tGenetics and Genomics in Healthcare\t2 crCourses may be repeated only once. No more than three required courses may be repeated. All credit for required courses must have been earned in the 10 years preceding progression into the nursing major. Grades of less than 2.0 (C) must be replaced by grades greater than 2.0 (C) no later than August for fall applicants.&nbsp;Achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.75 on a 4.0 scale. This GPA is computed on the courses listed above. Achieve a minimum science grade point average of 2.50 on a 4.0 scale. This GPA is computed within the required sciences.&nbsp;Achieve a minimum grade of 2.0 (C) in each of the required nursing and non-nursing courses as listed under part A.&nbsp;Remove all incompletes and replace with acceptable grades before beginning the nursing major.&nbsp;In addition to the satisfactory completion of courses listed in part A, applicants must demonstrate competency in math and English. Competencies must be fulfilled through testing or course work by the date of entry into the nursing major. Information about competency testing is available through the Consortial Nursing Office. Refer to the UW-Parkside Advising and Career Center for the definition of competencies.&nbsp;A statement written by the applicant.&nbsp;Meet application deadlines.&nbsp;A letter of recommendation is required if an applicant has been enrolled in clinical nursing courses at another school of nursing. This reference must be from the director of that College of Nursing. The letter should reflect a positive recommendation for the student’s progression into the nursing major.&nbsp;An interview with the student making an application may be requested at the discretion of the Undergraduate Program Committee.&nbsp;Following a review of the student’s record and the progression of the student into the nursing major, the Undergraduate Program Committee may make recommendations intended to assist the student. These recommendations will be communicated to the student.* Enrollment in freshman-level courses is based on ACT scores and in some cases, placement testing. As a result of ACT scores or placement testing, one or more preparatory courses may be required before enrollment in higher-level courses is permitted. Credits earned at the Academic Skill course/ASCK level in preparatory courses and English 100 do not apply to the 124 credits required for graduation.&nbsp;Student Responsibilities in the Nursing MajorStudents are expected to provide their own transportation, uniforms, books, supplies, equipment and other learning resources such as clients for practice experience as deemed necessary to meet course objectives.HealthGood physical and mental health is essential for study and practice in professional nursing. The faculty of the College of Nursing reserves the responsibility for retaining only those students who demonstrate qualities of physical and mental health generally considered to be imperative for professional nursing practice.A physical examination and specified immunizations are required of all students prior to enrollment in nursing practice courses. Expenses of this examination are the student’s responsibility. Evidence of a physical examination, to be completed by a nurse practitioner, university physician, or a physician of the student’s choice, must be submitted to Tallent Hall L180 on a date specified by the College of Nursing. The examination must be completed within one year before the date on which the student begins clinical nursing course work. Students who do not meet these health requirements may not be able to continue in the nursing major.After an offer of admission to the nursing, major is made, admission is contingent upon demonstration of satisfactory health as evidenced by physical examination and fulfillment of the health and immunization requirements by the appropriate deadline. The College of Nursing reserves the right to require a student to seek the advice of healthcare professionals where it is believed that a condition of health would impede his/her progress or jeopardize the health of others. The College of Nursing does not discriminate based on a disability and provides reasonable accommodation to qualified students on an individual basisStudents are required to pass a 10 panel urine drug screen prior to continuing in a clinical nursing practicum course. The purposes of the drug screen are to comply with expectations of area health care agencies, to provide optimal healthcare, and to support professional nursing’s zero-tolerance position related to the unlawful use of substances. Students must abide by the drug screen policies of each healthcare agency to which they are assigned for clinical practicums.Illness or Prolonged AbsenceStudents are expected to be present at all scheduled classes and clinical laboratory experiences. Since space in nursing courses is assigned during the first week of the semester, students are expected to be present for all instructional periods during that week as well. Frequent or prolonged absences from scheduled classes and/or clinical experiences may necessitate that the student drop a nursing course. Any planned interruption in course work should be discussed with the student’s instructor(s), course coordinator and the nursing advisor.CPR CertificationStudents must be certified in CPR at the health professional level prior to the first day of classes for the first semester in the nursing major. The authorized program is offered by the American Heart Association. Local community groups offer programs sponsored by this agency.Students admitted to the major must provide clinical instructors with a copy of their CPR card at the first meeting of their clinical lab group. Evidence of continued certification in CPR will be required throughout the program.Background CheckUpon admission to the nursing major, successful completion of a criminal background check is required. Should a background check reveal that a student has a history of a criminal charge and/ or conviction, they will be asked to make an appointment with the Academic Affairs Coordinator to discuss the implications of this finding on their educational plan. For all criminal background findings, the decision to accept a student for clinical placement will be made by the clinical agency, not the College of Nursing. More information on the Wisconsin Caregiver Background Check Law is available at http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/caregiver/. Consult with the College of Nursing Office of Academic Affairs at 414-229-2310 with questions specific to this area.A processing fee will be charged for the background check. Additional fees will be charged for students who have resided outside of Wisconsin in the past three years.Requirements for Employment, Licensing and Professional PracticeStudents should be aware that some professions, occupations, and employers are subject to licensing and/or bonding requirements. When a course of study includes clinical or field training, practice teaching, internships, or the like, students may be subjected to a check of criminal conviction records prior to acceptance of a student by the placement site. Students are responsible for obtaining the information necessary for them to become knowledgeable about these requirements and plan their studies accordingly.Professional CredentialsWisconsin state law requires nurses to be licensed to practice nursing within the state. Licensure is obtained by endorsement or by passing an examination. Students graduating from the College of Nursing are eligible to write the examination if they:are at least 18 years of age,are graduates of a high school or its equivalent,are able to speak, read, and write English,can attest they are U.S. Citizens, andpay the fee for licensure.Applicants for registration/licensure in the state of Wisconsin will be asked to state if they have ever been convicted of a criminal offense, excluding minor traffic violations. When individuals have such a conviction, an explanation is requested. An investigation may follow depending upon the circumstances and all the facts related to the situation.Safe Professional Practice in Clinical SettingsStudents are expected to demonstrate patterns of professional behaviors that follow the legal and ethical codes of nursing; promote the actual or potential well-being of clients, health-care workers, and self in the biological, psychological, sociological, and cultural realms; demonstrate accountability in preparation, documentation, communication, and continuity of care; and show respect for the human rights of individuals. A student whose pattern of behavior is found to be unsafe may be terminated from a clinical practicum for the reason of unsafe practice at any time during the semester. If the behavior is identified before the drop date, the student will be directed to drop. If the drop date has passed, the student will receive a grade of F for the course. In order to continue in the nursing program, a student who is terminated from a clinical practicum must appeal to the Undergraduate Program Committee for readmission to the nursing program.TravelStudents in nursing are responsible for arranging transportation to and from all agencies or clients’ homes used to provide clinical experience for the program. They are also responsible for any related liability. Students are expected to carry insurance on their vehicles.UniformsInformation about the uniform is shared at the nursing orientation and again in NURS 353 courses.
