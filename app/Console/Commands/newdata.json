You will gain powerful and sometimes surprising insights into insights into the way we humans across the globe organize and understand our lives. What are “different cultures”? How can we learn to understand power relations in various societies? We approach such questions by looking at patterns and changes and comparing them. This leads us to think about the ways we position ourselves in the world and our environments.\r\n\r\n**The Course Fee is calculated according to a per credit system.

It focuses on the responsible use and protection of the natural environment through practices based on Indigenous ways of knowing and doing and the practice of Indigenous land ethics grounded in Indigenous epistemologies, ontologies, traditions and aspirations. By explicitly recognizing the inherent validity and value of Indigenous ways of knowing and doing, this interdisciplinary program offers a critical, yet constructive, view of environmental science, grounded in Indigenous knowledge systems, methodologies, priorities and values and oriented towards concrete action. In addition to their studies of natural and applied science, students will examine the historical and contemporary relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada and the legal, political and economic context of environmental science and practice.",

By explicitly recognizing the inherent validity and value of Indigenous ways of knowing and doing, this interdisciplinary program offers a critical, yet constructive, view of environmental science, grounded in Indigenous knowledge systems, methodologies, priorities and values and oriented towards concrete action. In addition to their studies of natural and applied science, students will examine the historical and contemporary relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada and the legal, political and economic context of environmental science and practice.\nSchedule of StudiesCourse ListCode&nbsp;Title&nbsp;CreditsSemester 1CHEM*1040&nbsp;General Chemistry I&nbsp;0.50ENVS*1040&nbsp;Natural History of the Great Lakes Region&nbsp;0.50IES*1010&nbsp;Introduction to Indigenous Environmental Science and Practice&nbsp;0.50INDG*1100&nbsp;Indigenous Language and Culture&nbsp;0.50MATH*1080&nbsp;Elements of Calculus I&nbsp;0.50Semester 2ACCT*1220&nbsp;Introductory Financial Accounting&nbsp;0.50BIOL*1070&nbsp;Discovering Biodiversity&nbsp;0.50IES*1020&nbsp;Indigenous Knowledge for Environmental Science and Practice&nbsp;0.501.00 electives or restricted electives&nbsp;1.00Semester 3BIOL*2060&nbsp;Ecology&nbsp;0.50IES*2010&nbsp;Land-Based Teachings for Environmental Science and Practice&nbsp;0.50STAT*2040&nbsp;Statistics I&nbsp;0.501.00 electives or restricted electives&nbsp;1.00Semester 4GEOG*2210&nbsp;Environment and Resources&nbsp;0.50GEOG*2480&nbsp;Mapping and GIS&nbsp;0.50ANTH*2660&nbsp;Contemporary Indigenous Peoples in Canada&nbsp;0.50or HIST*2090&nbsp;Indigenous Peoples of the Americas1.00 electives or restricted electives&nbsp;1.00Semester 5ANTH*3650&nbsp;The Anthropology of Indigenous Peoples Before Canada&nbsp;0.50IES*3020&nbsp;Right Relations: Reconciliation, Decolonialization, &amp; the Environment&nbsp;0.501.50 electives or restricted electives&nbsp;1.50Semester 6POLS*3340&nbsp;Indigenous Politics in Canada&nbsp;0.502.00 electives or restricted electives&nbsp;2.00Semester 7GEOG*3210&nbsp;Indigenous-Settler Relationships in Environmental Governance&nbsp;0.50IES*4000&nbsp;Indigenous Environmental Science: Methodologies in Practice&nbsp;0.501.50 electives or restricted electives&nbsp;1.50Semester 8IES*4010&nbsp;Indigenous Environmental Science Project&nbsp;0.50IES*4020&nbsp;Indigenous Environmental Science Reflective Capstone&nbsp;0.501.50 electives or restricted electives&nbsp;1.501Note: Students who are not native speakers of an Indigenous language must take INDG*1100.

The degree offers strong comprehensive theory-based courses and a high level of experiential and applied learning. Courses are designed to develop well-rounded students who have a high level of climate change science knowledge supported by highly relevant skills needed to utilize climate change related technology. Faculty members teaching within the Bachelor of Science in Applied Climate Change and Adaptation program are focused on providing quality instruction and student growth within a cohort-based learning community. Graduates of the program will emerge ready to pursue various climate change related careers, professional studies, or graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis program of study examines \"climate change adaptation\" which refers to the adjustments that societies or ecosystems make to limit the negative effects of climate change or to take advantage of opportunities provided by a changing climate. Adaptation can range from a farmer planting more drought-resistant crops to a coastal community evaluating how best to protect its infrastructure from rising sea level. Climate change is already impacting societies and ecosystems around the world, and many impacts are expected to increase as global temperatures continue to rise. While reducing greenhouse gas emissions is required to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, a certain amount of global warming is inevitable, due to the long-lasting nature of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere, and to heat already stored in the oceans. Adapting to the changes that are already underway, and preparing for future climate change, can help reduce the risks societies will face from climate change.\nYear 1ACC 1010 Introduction to PEI’s Living Climate LabACC 1020 Introduction to Climate Adaptation Tools and TechnologiesACC 2030 Indigenous Knowledge and Climate ChangeBIO 1010 Current Issues in Environmental BiologyCHEM 1110 General Chemistry ICS 1910 Computer Science IENV 1010 Introduction to Environmental StudiesMATH 1120 Calculus for Managerial Social and Life Sciences; or 1910 Single Variable Calculus IOne of the following electives:ACLC 1080 Digital LiteracyECON 1010 Introductory MicroeconomicsHIST 1010 Canadian History—Pre-ConfederationPHIL 1050 Technology, Values, and SocietyPHYS 1210 Physics for Life Sciences IPSY 1010 Introduction to Psychology: Part IOne of the following UPEI courses:UPEI 1010 Writing StudiesUPEI 1020 Engaging Ideas and Cultural ContextsUPEI 1030 Engaging University Contexts and ExperiencesYear 2ACC 1030 Surveying Cultural Landscapes in the Environmental HumanitiesACC 2020 Impacts of Canadian Climate Policy and PoliticsBIO 3270 Field Coastal EcologyCHEM 2020 Environmental ChemistryENV 2120 Earth’s Physical EnvironmentENV 3110 Understanding Climate ChangePHYS 2630 Atmospheric and Ocean PhysicsSTAT 1910 Introduction to Probability and StatisticsTwo of the following electives:ACLC 2030 Introduction to Leadership StudiesACLC 2090 Digital HumanitiesENG 2060 Critical Approaches to Texts IENV3210 Natural HazardsENV 3420 Environment and DevelopmentENV 3510 Sustainable&nbsp; Community PlanningMATH 1920 Single Variable Calculus IIPHIL 3020 Environmental Philosophy (was 2030)SAN 2660 Science, Culture and SocietySummer SessionACC 2160 Work Integrated Learning IYear 3ACC 3010 Global Climate Systems and ScienceACC 3020 Climate Futures and ModellingACC 3030 Climate Change MonitoringACC 3040 Climate Change Statistics in RACC 3050 Renewable Energy and Clean TechnologiesACC 3060 Remote Sensing and Climate ChangeACC 3090 Geographic Information Systems for Climate ChangeACC 3100 Climate Change Impacts on Biodiversity and EcosystemsACC 3120 Canadian Climate Change Management&nbsp;ACC 3140 Carbon Pricing Mechanisms and Business Risk Assessment&nbsp;Summer SessionACC 3160 Work Integrated Learning IIYear 4ACC 3080 Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Climate Mitigation)ACC 4010 Climate Coastal ScienceACC 4020 Uncertainty and Probability in Climate ChangeACC 4040 Virtual Reality and Climate ChangeACC 4060 Measuring Your Carbon Footprint through Carbon AccountingACC 4070 Climate ExtremesACC 4080 Climate Change Impacts and AdaptationACC 4120 International Climate DiplomacyTwo ACC electives at the 4000 level\nEntry Requirements:IB: 24Must have a Year 12 passCandidates are considered for admission based on their average in Grade 12: academic English, academic Math, and two academic Sciences from the following list (academic Chemistry, academic Biology, academic Physics); one other Grade 12 academic subject; minimum overall average of 70% with no individual grade below 65%.Applicants whose average in English, Math and two of Biology, Chemistry, or Physics, is 89% and above when final results for first semester grades are obtained will receive an \"Early Offer\" of admittance.

The program shares courses with the Electrical Engineering Program that cover general electrical engineering, analog and digital electronics, signal processing, communications, and computers. Topics specific to Computer Engineering are studied in specialized focus areas in the third and fourth years.\r\n\r\nAll undergraduate students admitted to the College of Engineering are required to complete a common first-year of undeclared studies (known as the first-year common core). Once the first-year common core program has been completed, undergraduate students declare their preferences and compete for admission into an upper-year program. Students who are successful in securing admission into an upper-year program are required to follow the program of study that is prescribed at the time of their admission into the upper-year program.\nYear 1 (34 credit units)All Engineering programs have a common first year.Year 2 (34 credit units)Fall TermCMPT 141.3 Introduction to Computer ScienceEE 205.1 Safety and Stewardship in
